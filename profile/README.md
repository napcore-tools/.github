# NAPCORE Tools (GitHub organization)

Welcome page for **Public**

## Overview

NAPCORE Task 5.2 develops open-source digital tools for European mobility data services, supporting standardized data exchange and interoperability across transport systems.

## üîß Our Tools

We are planning to develop or support development of various types of tools such as:

- **Data Validators** - Validate DATEX II, NeTEx, SIRI, and TN-ITS data
- **Format Converters** - Convert between APDS, DATEX II, and NeTEx formats
- **Version Upgrade Tools** - Upgrade data and their schemas from one standard version to another one
- **Reference Implementations** - Documentation and examples

All the tools will be publicly presented on NAPCORE Store website.

## üìö Getting Started

Initially, development is to be done by NAPCORE project members only. Later we will open our tools to public.

If you are a NAPCORE participant willing to contribute to our tools, use your NAPCORE contacts to ask Task 5.2 leader (Jan Vlƒçinsk√Ω + Roman Ho≈ôe≈àovsk√Ω) to become member of NAPCORE Tools GitHub organization.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

Our initial plan for repository naming is as follows:

- `mng-*` - Project management (focused mainly on coordination with WG4 tasks)
- `internal-*` - Internal processes
- `web-*` - Web interfaces (namely NAPCORE Store)
- `tool-*` - Production tools
- `refimpl-*` - Reference implementations
- `fstudy-*` - Feasibility studies

## Repository Plan

This is initial plan of repositories in our organization:

- Initial set is created (`.github*`, `discussions`, `internal-*`, `mng-*`).
- Remaining ones is initial estimation and is subject to backlog evaluation where we will decide, which products are to be really developed.
